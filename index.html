<p>Android is a Linux-based mobile operating system (OS) developed by the Open Handset Alliance, 
which is led by Google. Android is one of the best-selling smartphone platforms worldwide, 
with over 700,000 Android devices activated every day as of December 2011.
</p>
<p> It was initially developed by a small company aptly named Android. 
It was purchased in 2005 by Google Inc. It is used by a wide variety of manufacturers like HTC, 
Motorola, LG, Samsung, and many others. Most of the manufacturers just happen to be apart of the Open 
Handset Alliance as well.

Android OS version software releases have a unique characteristic of being named after various deserts. 
1.5 was known as doughnut, 1.6 was referred to as cupcake, etc. The list of Android OS versions are as 
follows:
</p>

<ul id="android_vers">
<li>
1.5: Doughnut
</li>
<li>
1.6: Cupcake
</li>
<li>
 2.0: Eclair 
</li>
<li>
 2.1: Eclair
</li>
<li>
 2.2: Froyo
</li>
<li>
2.3: Gingerbread
</li>
<li>
3.0: Honeycomb (tablet only)
</li>
<li>
4.0: Ice Cream Sandwich (table and mobile OS)
</li>
</ul>
<p>  
In regards to the design of the Android UI (user interface) it is very similar to another very popular
 mobile OS, with that OS being the iOS of Apple's iPhone line. It is because of this fact that Android is 
 viewed as user-friendly like the famous OS from Apple. However, there are enough differences between the 
 two warrant Android as something other than an iOS clone.

With the various major cell phone carriers switching from basic cell phones to internet fueled smartphones a 
growing need to educate customers about the uses of smartphones have arisen. As the four carriers roll
 out their own implementations to educate customers we have also decided to establish a forum to do 
 just that.

<p>According to Pew Internet and Life about one-third of U.S. adults in this country own a smartphone. 
About eighty three percent own a cell phone and roughly half of that number of people own a smartphone. </p>

<p>This is proof that a growing number of people have shown interest in owning a device that can 
do more than make calls. Like it or not, smartphones are here to stay. However, it is because of 
this growing interest in smartphones that the need to educate customers on how to use and maintain 
their devices have arisen.
